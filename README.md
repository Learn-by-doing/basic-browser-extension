## Load the Extension in Chrome

From the Chrome extensions [getting started guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted):

> Extensions that you download from the Chrome Web Store are packaged up as `.crx` files, which is great for distribution, but not so great for development. Recognizing this, Chrome gives you a quick way of loading up your working directory for testing. Let's do that now.
> 
> Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
> 
> [Make sure] that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
> 
> Click "Load unpacked extension..." to pop up a file-selection dialog.
> 
> Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.
> 
> If the extension is valid, [it will] be loaded up and active right away! If [it is] invalid, an error message will be displayed at the top of the page. Correct the error, and try again.


## Make a Change

Open the project folder in your preferred text editor and make some changes to the extension. When you're ready to try out your changes, re-load the extension from the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page in your browser.
